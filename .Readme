INTROUCTION:
Traffic congestion is a severe problem in many modern cities around the world. Traffic congestion has been causing many critical problems and challenges in the major and most populated cities. To travel different places within the city is becoming more difficult for the travellers in traffic. Due to these congestion problems, people lose time ,miss opportunities, and get frustrated. Traffic congestion directly impacts the companies. Due to traffic congestions there is a loss in productivity from workers, trade opportunities are lost, delivery gets delayed, and there by the costs goes on increasing. To solve these congestion problems ,we have to build new facilities& infrastructure but at the same time make it smart. The only disadvantage of making new roads on facilities is that it makes the surroundings more congested. So for that reason we need to change the system rather than making new infrastructure twice .Therefore many countries are working to manage their existing transportation systems to improve mobility ,safety and traffic flows in order to reduce the demand of  vehicle use. Therefore, many researches about traffic light system have been done in order to overcome some complicated traffic phenomenon but existent research had been limited about present traffic system in well travelled traffic scenarios. The time of allocation is fixed from east to west or opposite way and from north to south way in crossroads. 
Many system designs that used to be built in custom VLSI are now implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This is because of high cost of building a mass production of a custom VLSI especially for small quantity.

  DESIGN:
Verilog is hardware descriptive language (HDL) which is generally used to model electronic system. that is, we can design a circuit and the function of circuit can be control by Verilog coding. Thus, design and verification can be done using Verilog designing. Similarly, traffic light signal controlling can be done using Verilog (hardware descriptive language). so now we have design the traffic light signal system with Verilog using sequence detector method. We have considered area where there are two highways one from north-south and other from east-west. And heavy load of traffic present over these highways where we have to control these highways using traffic signal. If we want to keep flow of traffic at north-south end for particular time interval and simultaneously we allowed the traffic flow at east-west end.
Above blocks are the various stages of signalling mode. At each block has different pattern. RYG denotes (RED YELLOW GREEN). (NS) and (EW) denotes (NORTH-SOUTH END) and (EAST-WEST END). At each stage it has six-bit sequence as it can be observed through blocks. for example, at any stage if we have a sequence 100001 that means
So, at very 1st stage we have kept the traffic flow at north south end thus, bit signal for north-south will be 001(RYG) and simultaneously east-west end will have bit signal 100(RYG) Transition from red light to green light requires delay more. That means amount of time for the delay is more. Similarly transition from green light to yellow light requires moderate delay.
 
Transition of yellow light to red light requires very small delay as compared to other delays. In order to approach this project using Verilog we have to generate clock pulse and reset. For every positive clock pulse different stage will perform its operation. Generation of clock produces the synchronisation between all the signals.
process of any operation performs more efficiently if clock pulse is used. Then reset is used to rest the signal whenever reset vector is high. As our signalling bit is stored in 6-bit vector. As shown in above mention table. Next step is writing a testbench, which is most important parameter in Verilog. Whatever the task is performed in Verilog is group a set of repetitive or commands that is mentioned in always block while writing a testbench. In the testbench we can try up various possible inputs, outputs and in-outs so that it can be checked whether our tasks give correct or desired output or not. Output can be displayed using $display command in Verilog. in testbench we have to separately generate clock pulse. And we have to create UUT in which configuration of clock, reset, inputs, outputs used must be done. UUT is unit under test which is used for instance naming for a module.at the send of the testbench we have to give $stop command to terminate the process. After the successful execution processes of Verilog code and testbench, behavioural simulation, RTL simulation is also obtained which will give you an exact behaviour of the model.

 
OBESRVATION:
 Thus, traffic light control system helps to conduct orderly flow of vehicles. There are lot many issues of obstacles, high level accidents which occurs every day. So, traffic signal controller prevents such occurrences. Still many areas or small towns donâ€™t have the traffic light control facilities. And thus, many accident problems occur at those areas. Therefore, it is a primary purpose to have such facility in order to control and maintain the area
RESULT:
Traffic light controller is implemented successfully 
In this working model we have observed various stages which describes about every signals. At first stage (north-south end) signals gives some indication. Consider the signal is red that means signal at east-west side gives a green indication and traffic moves to their respective direction. Then after some delay yellow signal is obtain at east-west side and after the red signal arrives at the same time at the north-south end red signal goes off and green signal gets on and traffic moves to their particular direction. In this way process continues in the loop every day
